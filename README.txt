======================

This is a highly GNU/BASH related project for building some of the packages
I use. It is a rather old project of mine from some time ago. Recently I have
been reusing some of the functions I wrote for it to the extent that a rework
was justified. There are a lot of things I would like to change. There are a
lot of things I would like to do differently with it. As a project it is more
of a theoretical workbench for pristine source management and package building
using nothing but the shell and it should not be considered something more.

I will update this file once I believe that it is stable enough to be run by
others as a whole and not as a set of fully working functions with partial
interdependencies.
